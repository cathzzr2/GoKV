# GoKV ðŸ“Š

GoKV is a high-performance key-value store implemented in Go, leveraging the [bitcask](https://medium.com/@arpitbhayani/bitcask-a-log-structured-fast-kv-store-c6c728a9536b) model. It is designed for simplicity, speed, and flexibility, with optimization strategies to enhance data retrieval and storage. GoKV supports Redis data structures and offers a user-friendly HTTP API for interaction.
